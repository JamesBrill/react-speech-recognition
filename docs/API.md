## Interface

* [useSpeechRecognition](#useSpeechRecognition)
* [SpeechRecognition](#SpeechRecognition)

## useSpeechRecognition

React hook for consuming speech recorded by the microphone. Import with:

```
import { useSpeechRecognition } from 'react-speech-recognition'
```

### Input props

These are passed as an object argument to `useSpeechRecognition`:

```
useSpeechRecognition({ transcribing, clearTranscriptOnListen, commands, backspaceCommand })
```

#### transcribing [bool]

Is this component collecting a transcript or not? This is independent of the global `listening` state of the microphone. `true` by default.

#### clearTranscriptOnListen [bool]

Does this component clear its transcript when the microphone is turned on? Has no effect when continuous listening is enabled. `true` by default.

#### commands [list]

See [Commands](../README.md#Commands).

## backspaceCommand [string]

The command you'd like to be used to backspace (delete the last word) of `transcript`. This command should be included in `commands` array, the callback doesn't matter, you can use `()=>{}`

### Output state

These are returned from `useSpeechRecognition`:

```
  const {
    transcript,
    interimTranscript,
    finalTranscript,
    resetTranscript,
    listening,
    browserSupportsSpeechRecognition,
  } = useSpeechRecognition()
```

#### transcript [string]

Transcription of all speech that has been spoken into the microphone. Is equivalent to the final transcript followed by the interim transcript, separated by a space.

#### resetTranscript [function]

Sets `transcript` to an empty string.

#### listening [bool]

If true, the Web Speech API is listening to speech from the microphone.

#### interimTranscript [string]

Transcription of speech that the Web Speech API is still processing (i.e. it's still deciding what has just been spoken).

For the current words being spoken, the interim transcript reflects each successive guess made by the transcription algorithm. When the browserâ€™s confidence in its guess is maximized, it is added to the final transcript.

The difference between interim and final transcripts can be illustrated by an example over four iterations of the transcription algorithm:

| Final transcript | Interim transcript |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| 'Hello, I am' | 'jam' |
| 'Hello, I am' | 'jams' |
| 'Hello, I am' | 'James' |
| 'Hello, I am James' | '' |

#### finalTranscript [string]

Transcription of speech that the Web Speech API has finished processing.

#### browserSupportsSpeechRecognition [bool]

The Web Speech API is not supported on all browsers, so it is recommended that you render some fallback content if it is not supported by the user's browser:

```
if (!browserSupportsSpeechRecognition) {
  // Render some fallback content
}
```

It is recommended that you use this state to decide when to render fallback content rather than `SpeechRecognition.browserSupportsSpeechRecognition()` as this will correctly re-render your component if the browser support changes at run-time (e.g. due to a polyfill being applied).

## SpeechRecognition

Object providing functions to manage the global state of the microphone. Import with:

```
import SpeechRecognition from 'react-speech-recognition'
```

### Functions

#### startListening (async)

Start listening to speech.

```
SpeechRecognition.startListening()
```

This is an asynchronous function, so it will need to be awaited if you want to do something after the microphone has been turned on.

It can be called with an options argument. For example:

```
SpeechRecognition.startListening({
  continuous: true,
  language: 'zh-CN'
})
```

The following options are available:

##### continuous [bool]

By default, the microphone will stop listening when the user stops speaking (`continuous: false`). This reflects the approach taken by "press to talk" buttons on modern devices.

If you want to listen continuously, set the `continuous` property to `true` when calling `startListening`. The microphone will continue to listen, even after the user has stopped speaking.

```
SpeechRecognition.startListening({ continuous: true })
```

##### language [string]

To listen for a specific language, you can pass a language tag (e.g. `'zh-CN'` for Chinese) when calling `startListening`.

```
SpeechRecognition.startListening({ language: 'zh-CN' })
```

#### stopListening (async)

Turn the microphone off, but still finish processing any speech in progress.

```
SpeechRecognition.stopListening()
```

This is an asynchronous function, so it will need to be awaited if you want to do something after the microphone has been turned off.

#### abortListening (async)

Turn the microphone off, and cancel the processing of any speech in progress.

```
SpeechRecognition.abortListening()
```

This is an asynchronous function, so it will need to be awaited if you want to do something after the microphone has been turned off.

#### browserSupportsSpeechRecognition

The Web Speech API is not supported on all browsers, so it is recommended that you render some fallback content if it is not supported by the user's browser:

```
if (!SpeechRecognition.browserSupportsSpeechRecognition()) {
  // Render some fallback content
}
```

It is recommended that you instead use the `browserSupportsSpeechRecognition` state from `useSpeechRecognition` to decide when to render fallback content - that will correctly re-render your component if the browser support changes at run-time (e.g. due to a polyfill being applied).

#### getRecognition

This returns the underlying [object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition) used by Web Speech API.

#### applyPolyfill

Replace the default Speech Recognition engine (if there is one) with a custom implementation of the [W3C SpeechRecognition specification](https://wicg.github.io/speech-api/#speechreco-section). See [Polyfills](./POLYFILLS.md) for more information on how to use this.

```
SpeechRecognition.applyPolyfill(SpeechRecognitionPolyfill)
```
